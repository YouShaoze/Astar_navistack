Functions and work that needs to be done

The structure of the cells 
the f cost 
the h cost 
the parent cell

Add the required functions after starting to program Astar
Make the changes required for makeplan
Need to make the layout of the whole program

function list

getcoordinate()
//for getting the position relative to origin
Both the origin and the position of robot is eelative to the world frame in the beginnning
Now we convert the robot frame  to be relative to the origin.

convertToCellIndex()

newX = x / resolution

The x is in meters
reslution is in meters/pixel

So we get the pixel value of the point.
So is each pixel considered to be a cell??
or wat does the cell index correspond to

cellIndex = getCellIndex(newY, newX);

this func call gives the index to the newx and newy pixel points 

 getCellIndex(newY, newX);
 return (i*width)+j; 

SO giving it  astructure of 2 d arrays




convertToCoordinate()
getCellColID(index) * resolution;
 getCellRowID(index) * resolution;

So each index cooresponds to a pixel .
THey are arranged in a 1d array and this function gives back the x and y coordinate in meters
